            <p>Hi, I'm Leo! Originally from Argentina, I am currently living in York, UK. I come from a close-knit family that has always been a huge part of my life. My family means everything to me, and I cherish every moment that I get to spend with them. Whether we're enjoying a home-cooked meal together or exploring the beautiful sights of York, being with my family is what truly makes me happy.

                Aside from spending time with my loved ones, I have a passion for sports and technology. Playing basketball and football has always been a way for me to stay active and relieve stress. I love the adrenaline rush that comes with these sports, and I find them to be a great way to keep myself physically and mentally fit. When it comes to technology, I am always excited to learn about the latest advancements and gadgets. I am a computer enthusiast, and I enjoy tinkering with hardware and software to create the perfect setup. Overall, I am grateful for everything that life has brought me so far, and I'm eager to see what the future has in store.
